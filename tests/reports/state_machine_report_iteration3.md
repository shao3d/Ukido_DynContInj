# State Machine Test Report - Iteration 3
## Diverse Personas Testing

### Test: Агрессивный отец Виктор
**Expected signal:** price_sensitive  
**Accuracy:** 60% (3/5 correct)

#### Issues Found:
1. **Signal switching:** Incorrectly switched to exploring_only on steps 4-5
   - Step 4: "Покажите реальные отзывы" → exploring_only (should be price_sensitive)
   - Step 5: "Гарантии какие?" → exploring_only (should be price_sensitive)

2. **Tone mismatch:** Empathy tone dominates (4/5) instead of value focus
   - System responds to aggressive tone with empathy instead of value demonstration

3. **Generic offers:** All responses use same exploring_only consultation offer
   - Not using price_sensitive specific offers (discounts, value proposition)

#### Metrics:
- Response time: 7.97s average
- Signal stability: 2 changes (too many)
- Personalization: 100% offers but generic
- Tone consistency: 20% (mostly empathy instead of value)
- Few-shot relevance: 60%

**Overall Score: 6.0/10**

### Root Causes:
1. Router doesn't maintain price_sensitive signal when user asks for proof/guarantees
2. Response generator defaults to exploring_only offer regardless of signal
3. Aggressive tone triggers empathy response overriding signal-based tone

### Next Steps:
1. Strengthen price_sensitive signal persistence
2. Fix offer selection logic in response_generator.py
3. Improve tone selection to prioritize signal over aggression handling
